# NFC chest/back plate — production spec

**Design intent:** flush, deliberate hits register; glancing swipes don't.
Weapon/glove/arrow carries a passive NFC tag; vest carries reader zones.
Zone + attacker UID reported on every hit.

## Reader: Elechouse PN5321 MINI

| Spec | Value |
|---|---|
| Board | 25 × 16 × 4.4 mm |
| Antenna | **40 × 50 mm**, ferrite-backed (interference-resistant — doesn't care what's behind it) |
| Antenna cable | 10 cm, IPEX4/MHF4 or MX1.25 |
| Interfaces | SPI / I2C / UART (solder-pad select — **set to SPI**) |
| Price | $34.50 ea, $29.90 @ 10+ |
| Link | [elechouse.com/product/pn532-mini](https://www.elechouse.com/product/pn532-mini/) |

The 10 cm coax + IPEX4 connector are the fragile parts → keep them
**inside** the potted puck; run robust ribbon for the long haul.

**Puck** = PN5321 board + 40×50 antenna + 10 cm coax, all cast in clear
epoxy as one ~45×55×12 mm tile. Ribbon enters the epoxy and cures in
place — no exposed RF connector, no exposed solder.

## Wiring — per puck (6 conductors)

| Ribbon core | PN5321 pin | ESP32 | shared? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | VCC | 3V3 | bus |
| 2 | GND | GND | bus |
| 3 | SCK | P14 | bus |
| 4 | MISO | P27 | bus |
| 5 | MOSI | P13 | bus |
| 6 | **SS** | P4 / P16 / P17 / P25 / P26 | **per-puck** |

PN532 in SPI mode doesn't need RST or IRQ pins. Set the board's
interface-select solder pads to **SPI** before potting.

Firmware: `./flash.sh vest-nfc-pn532`. Edit `NFC_SS[]` in
`firmware/vest/main.cpp` to match the SS pins you wired.

## Waterproofing

- **Puck:** cast in 2-part clear epoxy in a ~50×60 mm silicone mold.
  Antenna face flush to the mold floor (thinnest epoxy over the coil =
  best range). Board + coax + first 20 mm of ribbon all submerged.
- **Ribbon run:** PVC jacket is already waterproof. Sleeve in braided
  loom for abrasion if desired.
- **Hip box:** IP65 junction box with cable glands (one per ribbon).
- **Swappable (default):** M8 6-pin IP67 panel jack potted into the
  puck edge; pre-molded M8 cable on the harness. O-ring seal when mated;
  dust cap when not.
- *Non-swappable alt:* pot the ribbon directly into the epoxy instead.
  Saves ~$50/vest, loses field repair.

## Layout — 5 zones

```
   chest                    back
┌─────────────┐        ┌─────────────┐
│ [0] [1] [2] │        │     [3]     │
│  L  ♥   R  │        │  shoulder   │
│             │        │     [4]     │
└─────────────┘        │   kidney    │
                       └─────────────┘
```

Each zone ≈ 40×50 mm read area. Gaps between are intentional.

**≈ $300/vest** — swappable pucks (default). Dead puck mid-game = 10-sec screw-swap. Tags (NTAG213
stickers) you already have — 50 covers all weapons + gloves + arrows.

## Game hooks

- **Back zones (3/4):** 2× damage or instant kill — rewards flanking
- **Heart (1):** instant kill on a dagger-tagged weapon only
- **Per-weapon rules:** UID → lookup table → arrows only score on chest,
  mace ignores zone, etc.
- **Tagged gloves:** punches score + ID the puncher
- Zone-colored hit flash on the LED bar
